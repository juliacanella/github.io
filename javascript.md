# JavaScript example for `SameSite=None; Secure`

Calls to `document.cookie` continue to work as they have before. You can provide
the `SameSite` attribute as part of the assigned string.

```js
// Set a same-site cookie for first-party contexts
document.cookie = 'cookie1=value1; SameSite=Lax';
// Set a cross-site cookie for third-party contexts
document.cookie = 'cookie2=value2; SameSite=None; Secure';
```
